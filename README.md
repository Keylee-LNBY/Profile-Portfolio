## Description 
This is a current an up-to-date profile with all of my contact information, links to deployed projects, and working histories. 
What it does, how it does it, why it does it
motivation for it
problem it solves: a streamlined way to display my coding 
what I learned
what makes my project stand out

=> As more features are added could create a features section

### Technologies Used
justify the technologies used 

### Challenges 
> My main challenge in building this site came with overwriting some of the elements within Materialize that I used. The Contact Page was the most challenging due with the icons & issues with trying to edit the label colors of the form. When researching out to edit these colors, I found that Materialize is still working on creating an effective way to edit these elements with CSS. So, in realizeing that I would be unable to edit the labels in the form I had to find a way to make the page cohesive with the index & portfolio pages while making the form legible. 

### Future Improvements 
> I will be working on 


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.



## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
